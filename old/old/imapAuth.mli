  (** The authentication function.  In order to perform SASL authentication,
      this function is called with each of the challenges from the server, in
      turn.  The challenges are not encoded.  For each challenge, it returns a
      pair [(rc, s)].  [s] is the string that needs to be sent back to the
      server.  [rc] is [`OK] if the mechanism does not need to be called again
      with more data from the server, and [`NEEDS_MORE] if it does.  This does
      not mean that the server will not send more data (for example, in case of
      authentication error), just that the mechanism does not need more data.
      Conversely, if the server behaves as if authentication is done, but this
      function has returned [`NEEDS_MORE], then something is amiss. *)
