(** Sets of message numbers

    The numbers are either "sequence numbers" or "unique identification
    numbers".  The sets are in the "formal" sense.  That is, the order and the
    reptitions matter.  The elements are kept in the order they are given.

    The elements of the set are unsigned 32-bit integers.  This is the data type
    that represents both IMAP sequence numbers and unique identification
    numbers, except for zero.  Zero will be interpreted as being IMAP '*', the
    highest possible number of the messages in the mailbox.

    Briefly, an expression such as 1:3,4,5:12,18:* will be represented by the OCaml
    list [[(1, 3); (4, 4); (5, 12); (18, 0)]]. *)

(** The type of sets, a formal, ordered, union of intervals. *)
type t = private (uint32 * uint32) list

val empty : t
(** The empty set. *)

val all : t
(** The interval of all positive numbers. *)

val single : uint32 -> t
(** The interval consisting of a single number. *)

val seq : uint32 -> uint32 -> t
(** The set consisting of a single interval. *)

val from : uint32 -> t
(** The half-interval starting from [n] (inclusive).  It corresponds to the
    IMAP expression "n:*". *)

val add : uint32 -> t -> t
(** [add n s] adds a single number [n] to the set [s]. *)

val add_seq : uint32 -> uint32 -> t -> t
(** [add_interval n m s] adds the whole interval between numbers [n] and [m]
    (including both [n] and [m]) to the set [s]. *)

val union : t -> t -> t
(** [union s1 s2] forms the union of the [s1] and [s2]. *)
